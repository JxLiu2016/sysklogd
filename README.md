Introduction
------------

This is the continuation of the original Debian/Ubuntu syslog daemon,
updated with full [RFC3164][] and [RFC5424][] support from NetBSD and
FreeBSD.  The package includes the `libsyslog.{a,so}` library and a
`syslog.h` header file replacement, two system log daemons, `syslogd`
and `klogd`, and one command line tool called `logger`.

`libsyslog` and `syslog/syslog.h`, derived directly from NetBSD, expose
`syslogp()` and other new features available only in [RFC5424][]:

- https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?syslog+3+NetBSD-current

The `syslogd` daemon is an enhanced version of the standard Berkeley
utility program, updated with DNA from FreeBSD.  It is responsible for
providing logging of messages received from programs and facilities on
the local host as well as from remote hosts.  Although compatible with
standard C-library implementations of the `syslog()` API (GLIBC, musl
libc, uClibc), `libsyslog` must be used in your application to unlock
the new [RFC5424][] `syslogp()` API.

The `klogd` daemon listens to kernel message sources and is responsible
for prioritizing and processing operating system messages.  The `klogd`
daemon can run as a client of `syslogd` or optionally as a standalone
program.  `klogd` can now be used to decode EIP addresses if it can
determine a `System.map` file.

The included `logger` tool can be used from the command line, or script,
to send RFC5424 formatted messages using `libsyslog` to `syslogd` for
local or remote logging.

Main differences from the original sysklogd package are:

- Support for `include /etc/syslog.d/*.conf`, see example .conf
- Built-in log-rotation support, with compression by default, useful for
  embedded systems.  No need for cron and a separate logrotate daemon
- Full [RFC3164][] and [RFC5424][] support
- Includes timestamp and hostname, RFC3164 style, in remote logging
- Support for sending RFC5424 style remote syslog messages
- Support for sending messages to a custom port on a remote server
- Includes a `logger` tool with RFC5424 capabilities (`msgid` etc.)
- Includes a library and system header replacement for logging
- FreeBSD socket receive buffer size patch
- Avoid blocking `syslogd` if console is backed up
- Touch PID file on `SIGHUP`, for integration with [Finit][]
- GNU configure & build system to ease porting/cross-compiling
- Support for configuring remote syslog timeout


Using -lsyslog
--------------

libsyslog is by default installed as a library with a header file:

```C
#include <syslog/syslog.h>
```

The output from the `pkg-config` tool holds no surprises:

```sh
$ pkg-config --libs --static --cflags libsyslog
-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lsyslog
```

The prefix path `/usr/local/` shown here is only the default.  Use the
`configure` script to select a different prefix when installing libsyslog.

For GNU autotools based projects, use the following in `configure.ac`:

```sh
# Check for required libraries
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([syslog], [libsyslog >= 2.0])
```

and in your `Makefile.am`:

```sh
proggy_CFLAGS = $(syslog_CFLAGS)
proggy_LDADD  = $(syslog_LIBS)
```



Build & Install
---------------

The GNU Configure & Build system use `/usr/local` as the default install
prefix.  In many cases this is useful, but this means the configuration
files and cache files will also use that same prefix.  Most users have
come to expect those files in `/etc/` and `/var/run/` and configure has
a few useful options that are recommended to use:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
    $ make -j5
    $ sudo make install-strip

You may want to remove the `--prefix=/usr` option.


Building from GIT
-----------------

If you want to contribute, or just try out the latest but unreleased
features, then you need to know a few things about the [GNU build
system][buildsystem]:

- `configure.ac` and a per-directory `Makefile.am` are key files
- `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from `autogen.sh`,
  they are not stored in GIT but automatically generated for the
  release tarballs
- `Makefile` is generated by `configure` script

To build from GIT you first need to clone the repository and run the
`autogen.sh` script.  This requires `automake` and `autoconf` to be
installed on your system.

    git clone https://github.com/troglobit/sysklogd.git
    cd sysklogd/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make

GIT sources are a moving target and are not recommended for production
systems, unless you know what you are doing!
